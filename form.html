    <h1>Problem Statement Of Smart Waste Bins</h1>
    <p>Based on recent research in Nairobi Kenya, trash cans in public areas are often flowing long before the next scheduled cleaning.</p><p> This hence causes problems like levels of gases, insects, rodents, and houseflies which make the environment around the estates unhabitable and cause serious health problems mostly for kids who tend to be prone to infections. </p>                                                                                                                              
    </p>This project aims to install chip sensors at the top of every waste bin around crowded areas. <p>Once the bins are full, the sensor will have to send a beep signal to the nearby garbage collection center.</p><p> They will then dispose of the waste and replace it with new bins. With this, the system will ensure that the environment is kept clean and curb environmental pollution by instant disposal of waste on time.
